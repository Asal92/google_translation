Renamed some variables to make them more clear.
Looks like it's not actually adding sentences because it's expecting there to be a space rather than these underlines so I'm confused.

I don't know what the preprocess function is for.

When I try to run the code, it doesn't seem to work because no sentences are added.

I'm going to actually switch to use Ku's branch rather than this one.

Unsure if I should rebase or how to do this best.
I'm worried that a merge will keep some changes from Asal or me that I don't want.
If I create a new branch, I have to rename this one.

That should actually be fine.
That's what I'll do, then.
