Renamed some variables to make them more clear.
Looks like it's not actually adding sentences because it's expecting there to be a space rather than these underlines so I'm confused.

I don't know what the preprocess function is for.

When I try to run the code, it doesn't seem to work because no sentences are added.

I'm going to actually switch to use Ku's branch rather than this one.

Unsure if I should rebase or how to do this best.
I'm worried that a merge will keep some changes from Asal or me that I don't want.
If I create a new branch, I have to rename this one.

That should actually be fine.
That's what I'll do, then.

Great, on the new branch now!

It's looking likely that neither Ku nor Asal followed the paper.
The paper doesn't linearize the tags while doing the Google Translate conversion.
Should I follow what my group has already done and call it a new technique?
Or should I stick to the paper and do it the right way?

Let's cut down the number of sentences we translate and see how long it takes / what the format of the output is like.

Ooh we actually already have examples of the output. Great!

Let's do it for French and see what happens! I think the postprocessing code will be broken but that's okay.
